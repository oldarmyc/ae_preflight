Note: The free space may have fallen below specific size requirements due to reserve space and/or small files placed on the mount after formatting. Confirm that the size is close to the requested size before proceeding.

Note: XFS file system should be formatted with the option ftype=1 in order to support the overlay driver  for docker. In order to fix the issue the file system will need to be recreated and can be done using the following example:
mkfs.xfs -n ftype=1 /path/to/your/device
